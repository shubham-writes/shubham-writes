### Hi there, I'm Shubham! 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned **Full Stack Developer** from **NIT Allahabad**. I love building products that solve real user problems with clean, scalable code.

Currently, I'm focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms** and building **[Mentisy](https://mentisy.com)**, a platform that makes photo sharing fair and fun.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Convex, Supabase, Node.js
* **Tools:** Git, Figma, VS Code

#### 🔭 What I'm Working On
* **Mentisy:** A PWA for fair photo trading using a unique "lock-and-blur" mechanic.
* **Open Source:** Contributing to web development tooling and documentation.

#### ⚡ Fun Fact
I once pivoted my entire startup because of a single user insight about "fairness" in photo sharing.
