### Hi there, I'm Shubham! 👋

I'm a **Product-Focused Frontend Engineer** from **MNNIT Allahabad** (NIT).
I bridge the gap between Mechanical Engineering precision and Software Engineering scalability. I specialize in building secure, real-time web applications that feel native.

Currently, I'm architecting **[Mentisy](https://mentisy.com)**, a "Fair Swap" social platform, while deep-diving into distributed systems and DSA.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript
* **State & Data:** Convex (Real-time DB), Zustand, TanStack Query
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
* **Ecosystem:** Clerk (Auth), PWA (Service Workers), UploadThing

#### 🔭 Featured Project
**[Mentisy](https://mentisy.com)** – *A Zero-Trust Photo Swap PWA*
* **The Problem:** Social apps allow "freeloading" (viewing without replying).
* **My Solution:** Engineered a cryptographic "Reply-to-Reveal" protocol where media is strictly hidden server-side until a fair exchange transaction is verified.
* **Key Tech:** Web Share Target API, ACID Transactions, Server-Side Schedulers.

#### ⚡ Fun Fact
I realized software engineering isn't just about code—it's about incentives. I pivoted my entire product strategy based on a single insight about "fairness" in digital interactions.
